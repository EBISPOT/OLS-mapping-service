This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  This ontology is currently under development. Weekly updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/). Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome, and should be directed to pheno@jax.org, Susan.Bello@jax.org or to GitHub tracker (https://github.com/obophenotype/mammalian-phenotype-ontology/issues) MGD is funded by NIH/NHGRI grant HG000330.","ONTOLOGY","","mp,MP","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Last updated in the ontology lookup service on 2020-04-27T14:38:45.775+0000"

"NMR","","nuclear magnetic resonance CV","This artefact is an MSI-approved controlled vocabulary primarily developed under COSMOS EU and PhenoMeNal EU governance. The nmrCV is supporting the nmrML XML format with standardized terms. nmrML is a vendor agnostic open access NMR raw data standard. Its primaly role is analogous to the mzCV for the PSI-approved mzML XML format. It uses BFO2.0 as its Top level. This CV was derived from two predecessors (The NMR CV from the David Wishart Group, developed by Joseph Cruz) and the MSI nmr CV developed by Daniel Schober at the EBI.  This simple taxonomy of terms (no DL semantics used) serves the nuclear magnetic resonance markup language (nmrML) with meaningful descriptors to amend the nmrML xml file with CV terms. Metabolomics scientists are encouraged to use this CV to annotrate their raw and experimental context data, i.e. within nmrML. The approach to have an exchange syntax mixed of an xsd and CV stems from the PSI mzML effort. The reason to branch out from an xsd into a CV is, that in areas where the terminology is likely to change faster than the nmrML xsd could be updated and aligned, an externally and decentrallised maintained CV can accompensate for such dynamics in a more flexible way. A second reason for this set-up is that semantic validity of CV terms used in an nmrML XML instance (allowed CV terms, position/relation to each other, cardinality) can be validated by rule-based proprietary validators:  By means of cardinality specifications and XPath expressions defined in an XML mapping file (an instances of the CvMappingRules.xsd ), one can define what ontology terms are allowed in a specific location of the data model.","ONTOLOGY","","nmrcv,NMRCV,NMR,nmr","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Last updated in the ontology lookup service on 2020-04-27T14:39:22.890+0000"

"BAO","","BioAssay Ontology","The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) describes biological screening assays and their results including high-throughput screening (HTS) data for the purpose of categorizing assays and data analysis. BAO is an extensible, knowledge-based, highly expressive (currently SHOIQ(D)) description of biological assays making use of descriptive logic based features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). BAO currently has over 700 classes and also makes use of several other ontologies. It describes several concepts related to biological screening, including Perturbagen, Format, Meta Target, Design, Detection Technology, and Endpoint. Perturbagens are perturbing agents that are screened in an assay; they are mostly small molecules. Assay Meta Target describes what is known about the biological system and / or its components interrogated in the assay (and influenced by the Perturbagen). Meta target can be directly described as a molecular entity (e.g. a purified protein or a protein complex), or indirectly by a biological process or event (e.g. phosphorylation). Format describes the biological or chemical features common to each test condition in the assay and includes biochemical, cell-based, organism-based, and variations thereof. The assay Design describes the assay methodology and implementation of how the perturbation of the biological system is translated into a detectable signal. Detection Technology relates to the physical method and technical details to detect and record a signal. Endpoints are the final HTS results as they are usually published (such as IC50, percent inhibition, etc). BAO has been designed to accommodate multiplexed assays. All main BAO components include multiple levels of sub-categories and specification classes, which are linked via object property relationships forming an expressive knowledge-based representation.","ONTOLOGY","","bao,BAO","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Last updated in the ontology lookup service on 2020-04-27T14:38:46.599+0000"

"CDAO","","Comparative Data Analysis Ontology","The Comparative Data Analysis Ontology (CDAO) provides a framework for understanding data in the context of evolutionary-comparative analysis.  This comparative approach is used commonly in bioinformatics and other areas of biology to draw inferences from a comparison of differently evolved versions of something, such as differently evolved versions of a protein.  In this kind of analysis, the things-to-be-compared typically are classes called 'OTUs' (Operational Taxonomic Units).  The OTUs can represent biological species, but also may be drawn from higher or lower in a biological hierarchy, anywhere from molecules to communities.  The features to be compared among OTUs are rendered in an entity-attribute-value model sometimes referred to as the 'character-state data model'.  For a given character, such as 'beak length', each OTU has a state, such as 'short' or 'long'.  The differences between states are understood to emerge by a historical process of evolutionary transitions in state, represented by a model (or rules) of transitions along with a phylogenetic tree.  CDAO provides the framework for representing OTUs, trees, transformations, and characters.  The representation of characters and transformations may depend on imported ontologies for a specific type of character.","ONTOLOGY","","cdao,CDAO","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Last updated in the ontology lookup service on 2020-04-27T14:38:24.571+0000"

In addition, many classes and properties have GENO URIs but are place holders for classes that will be imported from an external ontology (e.g. SO, ChEBI, OBI, etc).  Furthermore, ongoing work will implement a model of genotype-to-phenotype associations. This will support description of asserted and inferred relationships between a genotypes, phenotypes, and environments, and the evidence/provenance behind these associations.

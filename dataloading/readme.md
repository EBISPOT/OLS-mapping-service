### Project structure

- The *oxo folder* contains the scripts to create the csv raw files that are imported into oxo as 'related'
- The *paxo folder* contains the scripts to predict mappings.
- The *standard folder* contains a dummy standard file to demonstrate how a standard file should be formated. A standard can be used to validate the mapping result against

### Installation of requirements
To run the scripts in both folders some libaries have to be installed. This is best done in a virtualenv and followed by:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

This API supports the following HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource
| `POST`
| Used to POST a search request
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

This API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a resource will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]


[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

This API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found benath the `_links` key. Client applications should follow
the `_links` to access resource URLs wherever possible.

[[overview-pagination]]
== Listing resources

Requests that return multiple resources will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can change number of items
returned using the `size` parameter up to a maximum of 500 for a single request. The API also supports the `page`
parameter for accessing a specific page of items.

=== Paging resources

Links will be provided in the response to navigate the resources.

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/page-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

[source,http]

[[resources]]
= Resources


[[resources-api]]
== API
The api endpoint provides the entry point into the service.


[[resources-api-access]]
=== Accessing the API

A `GET` request is used to access the API

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/api-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

include::{snippets}/api-example/response-fields.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/api-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-api-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/api-example/links.adoc[]

[[resources-terms]]
== Terms

The Terms resource is used to list terms in OxO

[[resources-terms-list]]
=== Listing terms

A `GET` request will list all of the OxO terms.

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/terms-list-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

The response is <<overview-pagination,paginated>> where the individual <<resources-term,term resources>>  are in the `_embedded.terms` field.

[[resources-term]]
== Term

=== Retrieve a term

include::{snippets}/term-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/term-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/term-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-term-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/term-example/links.adoc[]

[[resources-mappings]]
== Mappings

The mappings resource is used to list mappings in OxO

[[resources-mappings-list]]
=== Listing term mappings

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/mappings-list-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

The response is <<overview-pagination,paginated>> where the individual <<resources-mapping,mapping resources>>  are in the `_embedded.mappings` field.

[[resources-mapping]]
== Mapping

=== Retrieve a mapping

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/mapping-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/mapping-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/mapping-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-mapping-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/mapping-example/links.adoc[]

[[resources-datasources]]
== Datasources

The datasources resource is used to list mappings in OxO. Datasoources can be the source of terms or the source of mappings. E.g. All terms with the EFO prefix
are from the EFO datasource. The EFO datasource may also provide mappings between terms e.g. EFO includes mappings between Orphanet and the Human Disease Ontology.

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/datasources-list-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

The response is <<overview-pagination,paginated>> where the individual <<resources-datasource,datasource resources>>  are in the `_embedded.datasources` field.

include::{snippets}/datasource-example/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/datasource-example/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Example response

include::{snippets}/datasource-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[resources-datasource-links]]
==== Links

include::{snippets}/datasource-example/links.adoc[]

[[search]]
= Search

== Search mappings

The OxO search endpoint allows you to retrieve multiple mappings in bulk based on a set of input terms. You can also use the search endpoint
to take advantage of OxO's unique mapping distance feature. Mapping distance is a how many hops across other mappings you need to go to find this mapping.
Distance 1 is a direct mapping, the greater the distance the less likely it is that a mapping holds true. You can use the mapping distance to find all potential mappings, but we encourage
these mappings to be validated through manual curation. The good news is you can contact us to submit your manually curated mapping back to OxO so they can be shared with others.

include::{snippets}/search-by-ids-to-json/curl-request.adoc[]

=== Search parameters

Post a JSON object object with the following properties

|===
|Property|Description

|`ids`
| List of term ids that you want to map
|`inputSource`
| You can use input source to map all is from a given source rather than provide every id e.g. you can set the input source to `efo` and you will get mappings for every EFO term.
|`mappingTarget`
| Restrict your search to only inlclude mappings to set of target datasources. You can list the datasources by id.
|`mappingSource`
| Restrict the search to only include mappings from a certain datasource.
|`distance`
| Set the max mapping distance allowed. By default this is 2. Use distance 1 for direct asserted mappings.
|===

==== Response format

You can get the search result in JSON, CSV or TSV format. Simply add a `format` parameter to the search URL to set the response type.

----
$ curl 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/api/search?format=csv' -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
----

You can also set the response format using HTTP headers of either `Accept: text/csv` or `Accept: text/tsv`
